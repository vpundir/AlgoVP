## SCRUM MASTER FUNDAMENTALS

### Q1: What is the role and responsibility of a Scrum Master? How is it different from a Project Manager?

**Answer:**

A Scrum Master is a **servant leader** and facilitator, not a manager or commander.

**Core Responsibilities:**
- **For Product Owner**: Guide them in backlog grooming and requirement prioritization, ensuring proper guidance rather than command
- **For Developers**: Help them be self-organized, pick their own user stories, and understand outcomes
- **For Management**: Educate them about Scrum, Agile values, roles, and how to support team success
- **General**: Act as a protector of the team from external interruptions while fostering self-organization

**Key Difference from Project Manager:**
- **Project Manager**: Makes decisions for the team, raises access requests on behalf of employees (creates dependency)
- **Scrum Master**: Guides the team to solve problems independently, teaches them step-by-step how to access resources, encouraging self-organization

**Example**: When a developer needs tool access:
- **PM**: "I'll raise the ticket for you"
- **SM**: "Here's the process; let me guide you through it so you can do it yourself next time"

**Real-World Application**: Scrum Masters should facilitate everything by making sure everyone is aligned, self-organized, and self-sufficient while protecting the team from over-commitment and external pressures.

### Q2: What do you understand by "People over Process"?

**Answer:**

"People over Process" means **prioritizing employee well-being and concerns over rigid processes**, but it does NOT mean abandoning all processes.

**Common Misconception:**
Many think this manifesto means no processes are needed in Scrum, which is wrong.

**Reality:**
- Processes are necessary for consistency and knowledge retention
- Example: When a developer leaves unexpectedly, onboarding documentation (a process) helps new team members understand the project without overwhelming others
- Balance: Implement processes that enhance skills and contribute to project value WITHOUT losing the essence of Agile

**Practical Application:**
When team members report they cannot meet a deadline due to health or personal issues, prioritize their well-being over strict adherence to the timeline. However, still maintain necessary documentation and processes for continuity.

**Key Takeaway**: Enable people to perform at their best by supporting their well-being, while maintaining essential processes that create accountability and knowledge preservation.

### Q3: What is your day-to-day responsibility as a Scrum Master?

**Answer:**

**At Team Level:**
- Connect with team members and identify impediments
- Guide the team on Scrum and Agile practices
- Facilitate Scrum ceremonies:
  - Sprint planning
  - Daily standups
  - Sprint reviews
  - Retrospectives
  - Backlog refinement sessions

**At Program Level (SAFe Environment):**
- Handle dependencies with other teams in Scrum of Scrums (SOS)
- Sync with stakeholders and other Scrum Masters
- Conduct capacity planning during PI planning
- Represent the team as a facilitator in PI planning
- Coach team members to align sprint goals with PI objectives
- Conduct breakout sessions for feature decomposition
- Track risks and dependencies across the program

## TEAM MANAGEMENT & DYNAMICS

### Q4: How do you help your team with user stories? (Creation to Execution)

**Answer:**

**Process Overview:**

1. **Requirements Clarity**
   - Conduct working sessions between Business Analysts, Architects, and Developers
   - Ensure developers understand business requirements and technical solutions
   - All stakeholders should be comfortable with requirements before refinement

2. **User Story Refinement**
   - Apply the **INVEST principle**:
     - **I**ndependent: No dependencies on other work
     - **N**egotiable: Details can be discussed
     - **V**aluable: Delivers clear value to users
     - **E**stimable: Team can understand scope
     - **S**mall: Can be completed in one sprint
     - **T**estable: Has clear acceptance criteria

3. **Story Creation Best Practices**
   - Ensure no external dependencies or risks
   - Features created by Business Analysts; user stories refined by developers
   - Stories should be independently releasable and testable
   - Estimation should include all testing phases (unit, staging, production)
   - Developers should not separate "development story" and "testing story" in different sprints

4. **Story Size**
   - Should fit within one sprint
   - If spanning multiple sprints, it's too large and needs breakdown
   - Each story must be independently completable and releasable

5. **Key Role as Scrum Master**
   - Educate the team on proper story structure
   - Ensure stories are independent, properly estimated, testable, and releasable
   - Create accountability within the team

---

### Q5: How do you measure that your Sprint is successful?

**Answer:**

**Success Metrics Depend on Team Maturity:**

**For New Teams (First 4-5 Sprints):**
- Team members are comfortable and making progress
- No need to measure velocity yet (they're still learning)
- **Key metrics:**
  - Happiness index (team satisfaction)
  - Transparency and sync among all members
  - Scope creep is well-managed
  - Team is comfortable with deliverables

**For Intermediate Teams (10-15 Sprints):**
- Velocity should be constant or gradually increasing
- Estimations are improving
- They're committing to realistic workload (not under or over-committing)
- **Key metrics:**
  - Sprint goal achievement
  - Velocity trends
  - Negotiation and communication improvements

**For Mature Agile Teams:**
- All previous metrics apply, PLUS
- **Key metrics:**
  - Focus on increasing velocity
  - Self-organization for internal issues
  - Contributing to new requirements during Three Amigos sessions
  - Handling scope creep professionally

**Important Note:** Velocity should NOT be the only measure. A team completing 50 points vs. 45 points on unknown work differs greatly from work on known features. Success depends on what type of work the team is doing.

---

### Q6: How do you handle scope creep in your team?

**Answer:**

**Step-by-Step Approach:**

1. **Assess the Situation**
   - Determine if the work is critical (affects timelines, cost, or competition)
   - If not critical and can wait, plan it for the next sprint

2. **For Critical Mid-Sprint Work:**

   **Before Taking It On:**
   - Ask developers for effort estimates
   - Inform upper management that other work will be impacted
   - Ensure developers understand the requirements (conduct refinement)

3. **Negotiate and Align**
   - **Negotiation is KEY**: If taking in new work, something must come out
   - Involve: Product Owner, Developers, Stakeholders, and Management
   - Ensure everyone understands the trade-offs
   - Maintain transparency about what will be pulled out of the sprint

4. **For Non-Critical Work:**
   - Give developers a few days to finish current work
   - Then start the new urgent work
   - This reduces context switching and stress

5. **Golden Rule:**
   - Developers should not be exhausted or pressurized
   - Everyone should be in sync regarding sprint commitments
   - Ensure transparency, negotiation, and collective decision-making

**Key Principle:** Scope creep cannot be a regular occurrence. When it happens, manage it transparently with proper negotiation and trade-offs.

### Q7: How do you coach a team as a Scrum Master?

**Answer:**

**Two-Part Approach:**

**Part 1: Diagnosis (Identify Gaps)**
- Identify where the team is lacking:
  - Knowledge gaps (estimation, Scrum, Agile)
  - Competency gaps
  - Technical gaps
  - Process gaps (not updating Jira, etc.)
  - Personal issues affecting performance

**Part 2: Create & Execute a Coaching Plan**
1. Create a roadmap based on identified gaps
2. Plan coaching sessions (weekly 30-40 minute sessions if possible)
3. Guide them to internal training resources or external certifications
4. If external help is needed, involve stakeholders and explain the learning curve

**Implement Scrum Values:**
- Ensure team speaks openly in calls (transparency)
- Team feels comfortable saying "no" to stories they don't understand
- Team asks questions without hesitation (psychological safety)
- Team feels heard and valued
- Build trust so team members share "silly questions" (which are often the most important)

**Implementation Timeline:**
- Initially it's messy with many questions
- Over time, team understands Scrum principles
- Expectations should be set: "Gradual learning, not immediate mastery"

## AGILE CEREMONIES & EVENTS

### Q8: Explain PI Planning (Program Increment Planning) - Complete Step-by-Step Process

**Answer:**

**Pre-PI Planning Phase (MESSCO Framework)**

- **M** - Miro/Mural boards ready and team trained on how to use them
- **E** - Epics aligned and clarified for the upcoming PI
- **S** - Sprints created in both collaboration tool and Jira
- **C** - Capacity planning completed (with buffer for emergencies)
- **O** - Older epics that carry over reviewed for completion prioritization

**During PI Planning:**

1. **Kickoff (Business Team)**
   - Business stakeholders present business functionalities expected for the quarter

2. **Product & Architecture Discussion**
   - Product Management breaks down business functionalities into features
   - Architecture Team discusses technical requirements, infrastructure, and technology stack

3. **Breakout Sessions (By Team)**
   - Each team breaks features into smaller functionalities and user stories
   - Provide rough estimations based on team's velocity
   - **Note:** Final estimations happen during sprint planning

4. **Risk & Dependency Management**
   - Identify dependencies with other teams
   - Use color coding: Red (not addressed), Green (addressed/low-priority), Amber (in-between)
   - Use **ROAM technique** for risks:
     - **Resolved**: Already being handled
     - **Accepted**: Acknowledged but not worth mitigating (low impact/probability or high cost)
     - **Owned**: Assigned to a team member to monitor
     - **Mitigated/Negotiated**: 1-2% chance; requires regular monitoring with assigned owner and check-in date

5. **Management Review**
   - Present plan to leadership for feedback

6. **Confidence Vote**
   - Team members vote on confidence level in the plan
   - If anyone votes below average, review plan again
   - Ask why they lack confidence and what could improve it
   - Conduct another management review if needed

7. **Finalize PI Objectives**
   - **70-80% Committed Objectives**: Agreed by team and stakeholders
   - **Uncommitted Objectives**: Risk exists, but team will complete if time allows after committed objectives

---

### Q9: How do you calculate team capacity at team level and program level?

**Answer:**

**Basic Formula:**
```
Team Capacity = (Number of Team Members × Sprint Duration in Days × Working Hours per Day) 
                - Planned Non-Working Time (Vacations, Holidays, Meetings)
```

**Example (10 Team Members, 10-day Sprint, 8 Working Hours):**
- Base: 10 × 10 × 8 = 80 man-days
- 2 people on vacation for 3 days = 6 days to subtract
- 1 public holiday for all = 10 days to subtract
- **Final Capacity: 80 - 6 - 10 = 64 man-days**

**Converting to Hours:**
- 64 man-days × 8 working hours = 512 actual hours

**Applying Focus Factor (Optional):**
- **Focus Factor** = True productive hours (accounting for ceremonies, ad-hoc requests, calls)
- Typically 80% of actual capacity is usable (20% overhead)
- **True Capacity: 512 × 80% = 409.6 productive hours**

**Industry Variation:**
- Some teams use 6 hours, 8 hours, 8.5, or 9 hours per day
- Some deduct focus factor upfront; others calculate actual hours and apply focus factor later
- **Principle remains the same**: Calculate available time and account for overhead

**Program Level (SAFe):**
- Aggregate individual team capacities
- Account for team dependencies
- Consider shared resources
- Plan across multiple teams and PI cycles

---

### Q10: Why do we calculate velocity if we have capacity in PI planning?

**Answer:**

**Key Difference:**

| Aspect | Capacity | Velocity |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Definition** | Available hours/effort | Completed story points (output) |
| **Focus** | INPUT | OUTPUT |
| **Variability** | Changes sprint-to-sprint | Relatively stable (averaged) |
| **Use** | Real hours available | Predictability for planning |

**Why Both Are Needed:**

1. **Capacity** gives actual available hours (hard numbers)
2. **Velocity** converts capacity into predictability
   - If 500 hours capacity → 45-50 story points delivered
   - If 400 hours capacity → likely 36-40 story points

**Predictability Method:**
```
Predicted Velocity = (New Capacity / Old Capacity) × Historical Velocity
```

**Example:**
- Historical: 500 hours → 50 points
- Next Sprint: 400 hours
- Predicted: (400/500) × 50 = 40 points

**Important Notes:**
- NOT a hard rule; just for predictability estimation
- Mature teams use this for planning, not pressure
- **Anti-pattern**: Don't directly convert hours to story points (bad practice)
- Velocity helps manage stakeholder expectations for releases

## SPRINT PLANNING & EXECUTION

### Q11: How do you manage dependencies in a SAFe environment?

**Answer:**

**Three Key Approaches:**

**1. Scrum of Scrums (SOS) & Dependencies Calls**
- Regular meetings (weekly or per-need) with all teams
- Use collaborative boards (Mural) to track:
  - Team A depends on Team B, C, D, etc.
  - Color code: Red, Green, Amber (as discussed in PI Planning section)

**2. Link Dependencies in Jira**
- Map story dependencies across teams
- If Team A's story in Sprint 3 depends on Team B's story in Sprint 2:
  - Link them in Jira
  - Monitor alignment during SOS calls
  - Follow up if dependencies are at risk

**3. Attend All Sprint Demos**
- Attend demos of other teams (not just your own)
- Understand what they're building
- Spot misalignments early
- Example: If Team B finishes deliverables for Sprint 2 but you need them for Sprint 3, you'll know in advance
- Can escalate or re-plan before impact occurs

**Key Benefit:** Early visibility prevents surprises and allows proactive planning.

---

### Q12: What factors do you consider when estimating a user story?

**Answer:**

**Important Clarification:** 
Scrum Master does NOT estimate; the **team** estimates.

**Key Factors Teams Should Consider:**

1. **Amount of Work**
   - How big is the story?
   - What is the scope of work required?

2. **Complexity**
   - How difficult is the story?
   - Are there technical challenges?

3. **Risk & Dependencies**
   - What dependencies exist?
   - What uncertainties could arise?
   - Include buffer for potential issues

4. **Complete Lifecycle**
   - Unit testing (local environment)
   - QA testing (staging environment)
   - Feature flag testing (behind-the-scenes before production)
   - Code review and linting resolution
   - Deployment

**Estimation Best Practices:**
- Do NOT estimate in isolation; consider the complete picture
- Account for all testing phases upfront
- Do NOT separate "development stories" and "testing stories" across sprints
- Ensure story size allows completion within one sprint
- If estimation feels high, break the story down further

---

## METRICS & KPIS

### Q13: What is Velocity and how do you use it without turning it into a performance metric?

**Answer:**

**Definition:**
Sum of story points successfully completed by the team that meet the Definition of Done during a single sprint.

**Proper Usage:**

1. **Calculate Average Velocity**
   - Take average over 3-4 sprints (4 is maximum; older data becomes stale)
   - Formula: (Sum of story points last 3-4 sprints) ÷ (Number of sprints)

2. **Use for Planning & Forecasting**
   - Sprint planning: Set realistic commitments
   - Release planning: Predict delivery timelines
   - **Example**: "Based on average velocity of 40 points, this 200-point feature will take 5 sprints"

3. **How NOT to Use It**
   - ❌ Compare teams (Team A vs Team B)
   - ❌ Evaluate individual performance
   - ❌ Pressure team to increase velocity ("Add more story points")
   - ❌ Show individual sprint velocities (creates unhealthy comparison)

**Better Performance Metrics Instead:**

1. **Predictability**: How often team meets commitments (target: 80-95%)
2. **Churn Rate**: Scope additions/removals mid-sprint as percentage
3. **Sprint Goal Achievement**: Percentage of stated sprint goals met
4. **Definition of Done Compliance**: Quality of deliverables

**Key Insight by Expert:**
A good Scrum Master reads velocity trends. A great Scrum Master explains WHY the trends exist.

**Watch for Trends:**
- **Spike**: Could indicate known work, new team member, or story point inflation (anti-pattern)
- **Plummet**: Could indicate new work complexity, team member absence, or unplanned dependencies
- Neither is inherently good/bad; context matters

---

### Q14: What is Capacity and how is it different from Velocity?

**Answer:**

| Aspect | Capacity | Velocity |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Definition** | Total available working time | Completed story points |
| **Measurement** | Hours available | Story points delivered |
| **When it changes** | Changes every sprint | Relatively stable (averaged) |
| **Used for** | Determining team's effort input | Forecasting team's output |
| **Primary purpose** | Sprint planning input | Release planning/forecasting |

**Capacity Calculation:**
```
Capacity = (Team Size × Sprint Days × Hours/Day) - Planned Non-Working Time
```

**Velocity Calculation:**
```
Average Velocity = (Sum of Story Points last 3-4 sprints) ÷ Number of Sprints
```

**Relationship Using Focus Factor:**
```
Focus Factor = Average Velocity ÷ Average Capacity
Predicted Velocity = New Capacity × Focus Factor
```

**Anti-Pattern - Resource Allocation Trap:**
- Teams commit to capacity in hours rather than story points
- This ignores historical performance and uncertainty
- **Solution**: Use story points based on historical velocity

**Devika's Expert Insight:**
Watch focus factor trends:
- **Dropping focus factor** = systemic problem (excessive unplanned work, context switching)
- Use this as conversation starter for deeper investigation

---

### Q15: How do you calculate Sprint Predictability and what factors affect it?

**Answer:**

**Definition:**
Rate at which the team predictably meets its sprint commitments.

**Formula:**
```
Sprint Predictability = (Actual Points Completed ÷ Points Committed) × 100
```

**Healthy Range: 80-95%**
- Below 80% = Team is overcommitting
- Above 100% = Team is undercommitting (also not ideal)
- Ideal: 80-85%

**Important Insight:**
If predictability is consistently 100% across multiple sprints, it's actually BAD—team is artificially creating perfect predictions by undercommitting. This is called "making artificially created perfect commitments."

**Factors That Distort Predictability:**

1. **Scope Creep**: Adding/removing items mid-sprint
2. **Poor Estimation**: Inaccurate story sizing
3. **Unforeseen Technical Issues**: Bugs, technical challenges discovered during work
4. **Dependencies**: Blocked by other teams or external factors
5. **Unplanned Work**: Production support, emergencies
6. **Team Capacity Changes**: Sick leave, unexpected absences

**When to Measure:**
- Sprint review: Assess outcome
- Sprint retrospective: Identify process improvements

**Key Takeaway:** Use predictability to identify process improvements, not to blame the team.

### Q16: What is the difference between Lead Time and Cycle Time? How to shorten them?

**Answer:**

**Definitions:**

| Metric | Definition | Formula |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **Lead Time** | Total time from customer request until delivery | Delivery Date - Request Date |
| **Cycle Time** | Time from when team starts work until delivery | Delivery Date - Started Date |

**Organizational Waiting Time:**
```
Organizational Waiting Time = Lead Time - Cycle Time
(This is wasted time where nothing was done)
```

**When to Use:**
- Sprint retrospective: Inspect and improve process efficiency
- Sprint review: Communicate delivery speed to stakeholders

**How to Shorten Both:**

1. **Limit Work in Progress (WIP)**
   - Improves focus and flow
   - Reduces context switching

2. **Break Down Work into Smaller Batches**
   - Faster feedback loops
   - Easier to manage and complete

3. **Automate Testing & Deployment**
   - Reduce manual handoffs
   - Faster delivery pipeline

4. **Streamline Handoffs**
   - Reduce organizational waiting time
   - Improve team collaboration

5. **Track Cycle Time by Workflow Step**
   - Example: Cycle time in "In Progress" vs "QA" vs "Done"
   - Identify exact bottleneck location
   - Target improvements to specific areas

**Expert Tip:** Use cycle time per workflow step to pinpoint where exactly the constraint exists.

---

### Q17: What does a Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD) show? How to interpret bottlenecks?

**Answer:**

**What It Shows:**
A graph where:
- **X-axis**: Time (sprints or weeks)
- **Y-axis**: Count of work items
- **Colored bands**: Different workflow statuses (To-Do, In Progress, QA, Done, etc.)

**Three Key Metrics Visualized:**

1. **Work in Progress (WIP)**: Vertical distance between bands
2. **Cycle Time & Lead Time**: Horizontal distance between bands
3. **Throughput**: Slope of the lines

**How to Interpret Bottlenecks:**

**Widening Vertical Gap in Any Band** = Bottleneck
- Items entering faster than leaving the stage
- Example: Wide gap in "QA" band = QA bottleneck

**Anti-Patterns Visible in CFD:**

1. **Work in Progress Overload**
   - "To-Do" line much steeper than "Done" line
   - Team starting too many things without finishing
   - Leads to context switching and slow delivery
   - **Remedy**: Enforce Work in Progress limits; freeze backlog top; enforce pull-only when capacity opens

2. **Batching Anti-Pattern**
   - "Done" line has step-like pattern (flat periods → sharp jumps)
   - Work completed but not updated in status
   - **Remedy**: Enforce strict Definition of Done; update board immediately; encourage continuous delivery

3. **Scope Creep**
   - Top of chart (total items) rises sharply during sprint
   - **Remedy**: Protect sprint from mid-sprint additions; use prioritized lanes for chaotic environments

**When to Use:**
- Sprint retrospectives: Analyze flow and identify improvements
- Daily scrum: Monitor daily flow
- Sprint reviews: Communicate progress to stakeholders

---

### Q18: What is Throughput and how is it different from Velocity?

**Answer:**

| Aspect | Throughput | Velocity |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Definition** | Number of items completed | Story points completed |
| **What it measures** | Count of work items | Size of work items |
| **Type of measure** | Objective (no estimates needed) | Subjective (story point estimates) |
| **Used in** | Kanban (flow-based) | Scrum (iteration-based) |
| **Calculation** | Number of completed items ÷ Time period | Sum of story points completed |

**When Throughput is Preferred:**
- Teams practicing pure Kanban
- Less prone to manipulation if vertical slicing is done correctly
- Avoids estimation overhead
- Favored by "No Estimation" movement

**Key Requirement:** Throughput accuracy depends on **vertical slicing** of stories (not breaking by role: dev story, test story, etc.)

**Throughput Benefits:**
- More objective measure
- Avoids estimation bias
- Simpler to track
- Enables probabilistic forecasting (Monte Carlo)

**Expert Insight:** If stories are NOT vertically sliced, throughput loses reliability because you can artificially increase count by creating many small stories.

---

### Q19: What is Work Item Age and why does it matter?

**Answer:**

**Definition:**
Time an item has been in the current workflow stage without being completed.

**Formula:**
```
Work Item Age = Current Date - Date Item Entered Current Stage
```

**When to Use:**
- Daily standups: Focus on completing oldest work first
- Retrospectives: Identify flow problems

**Why It Matters:**
- Longer an item sits incomplete → higher chance of:
  - Rework needed
  - Technical debt accumulation
  - Scope creep later
  - Item becoming irrelevant
  - Lost business value

**Best Practice:**
- If item exceeds 50% of average cycle time, bring it up in standup
- Follow "First In, First Out" (oldest first) policy in highly optimized teams

**Important Caveat:**
- Do NOT use work item age as sole priority
- Product Owner must still prioritize by business value
- Only use "oldest first" when value is equal

**Expert Tip:** "Never let work item age be the sole priority for the Product Owner. The team must ensure we're working on the highest business value items."

---

### Q20: How do you track quality of team's Definition of Done (DOD)?

**Answer:**

**Two Key Metrics:**

**1. Defect Escape Rate (DER)**
```
DER = (Defects found post-sign-off) ÷ (Total defects found) × 100
```

- Data sources: QA managers, DevOps, incident management systems
- Tracks reactive failures
- Rising DER = DOD checklist is not catching bugs
- **Insight**: If DER rises from 8% to 15%, your quality gates are false security

**2. Manual Effort in DOD Completion (MEDC)**
```
MEDC = (Manual hours spent on DOD per story) ÷ (Story points delivered)
```

- Data sources: Team logs, QA logs, deployment verification records
- Tracks proactive cost (labor)
- High MEDC = Human labor is the bottleneck
- If MEDC is high and DER is rising → manual checks are failing

**How to Present to Leadership (with Automation Case):**

**Winning Narrative:**
- "Defect escape rate increased from 8% to 15% over 3 sprints"
- "We're spending 20 hours monthly on manual regression testing"
- "Automating testing will reduce DER AND free up 15,000 pounds in annual capacity"
- **Calculate savings**: Annual team rate × Wasted manual hours

This makes it a business case, not just a technical request.

---

### Q21: How do you measure Cost of Delay for blocked items?

**Answer:**

**Definition:**
Financial or value impact of delayed delivery of blocked work items.

**Two Ways to Measure Cost of Delay:**

**1. Relative Value (Points-Based)**
- Most common in Agile
- Use story point value from Product Owner
- Used for prioritization

**2. Financial Value (Best)**
- More impactful for executive reporting
- Used for strategic investment decisions
- Not all companies allow access, depends on policies

**Formula:**
```
Cost of Delay = (Business Value or Points) × (Blockage Duration in days/hours)
```

**Example:**
- Item value: 100 points
- Blocked for: 5 days
- Cost of Delay: 100 × 5 = 500 point-days

**Data Sources:**
- Value: Product Owner
- Blockage duration: Project management tools (Jira, Azure DevOps, etc.)

**Why the Combination is Powerful:**

- **Subjective value alone**: Leadership sees hypothetical loss, doesn't feel impact
- **Time data alone**: Not quantified enough
- **Value × Time**: Quantifiable penalty imposed by system architecture/dependencies

**Use Cases:**
- Present to leadership in immediate meetings
- Justify deprioritizing new work in favor of removing blockages
- Advocate for removing systemic constraints

**Expert Insight:** Always pair subjective value assessment with objective time data for maximum impact.

### Q22: Team meets sprint goals but has 75% predictability. How to address without blame?

**Answer:**

**Step 1: Don't Assume—Use Data-Driven Approach**

Before assuming overcommitment, examine whether unstable inputs (scope creep) are sabotaging commitments.

**Step 2: Calculate Scope Change Index (SCI)**

```
SCI = (Unplanned points added) ÷ (Original committed points)
```

- Data sources: Jira (tickets added/removed after sprint planning)
- Threshold: Healthy SCI < 5%

**Step 3: Present Neutral Data in Retrospective**

"Our commitment reliability was 75%, meaning we finished 3 out of every 4 stories. Let's understand where the missing 25% went."

**Step 4: Address Based on SCI**

**If SCI is Low (<5%):**
- "Great job protecting sprint boundaries!"
- Issue is **internal**: estimation or hidden work
- **Coaching question**: "What internal or hidden work consumed that X% capacity we didn't budget for?"
- Focus on estimation accuracy and capacity planning

**If SCI is High (>5%):**
- Issue is **external**: scope creep
- **Coaching question**: "How do we protect our sprint commitments? What mechanisms can we put in place to ensure unplanned work is prioritized by PO?"
- Focus on sprint protection

**Key Technique: Use Powerful Questions**
- ❌ Don't ask "Why?" (defensive)
- ❌ Don't use negative words like "failure"
- ✅ Ask "What internal work consumed X% capacity?" (curious, non-blaming)
- ✅ Focus on "what" instead of "why"
- ✅ Explore without putting defenses up

## SCALING & SAFe FRAMEWORK

### Q23: How to provide delivery date predictions during release planning?

**Answer:**

**Problem:** Product Owners want exact dates; provide probabilistic forecasts instead.

**Solution: Burnup Chart + Monte Carlo Simulation**

**Step 1: Gather Historical Data**
- Collect team velocity over 8-12 sprints
- Document variability in velocity

**Step 2: Run Monte Carlo Analysis**
- Simulate thousands of potential completion scenarios
- Account for historical velocity variability
- Generate probability ranges

**Step 3: Present Probability Ranges**
Instead of: "We'll be done on March 15"
Present: 
- "50% chance: Done by March 15"
- "70% chance: Done by March 20"
- "90% chance: Done by April 1"

**Step 4: Communicate Risk Boundaries**
- Explain confidence levels
- Discuss what happens at outer bounds
- Show stakeholders the risk/confidence trade-off

**Benefits:**
- More realistic forecasting
- Transparent risk communication
- Better stakeholder expectations

### Q24: What is the cost of 30% unplanned work in the sprint?

**Answer:**

**Single Metric to Calculate: Monthly Opportunity Cost**

```
Monthly Opportunity Cost = (Total Feature Value per Month) × (Unplanned Work Ratio)
```

**Example:**
- Feature value: 100K per month
- Unplanned work: 30%
- Cost: 100K × 30% = 30K monthly loss

**Data Sources:**
- Tag all work as planned/unplanned (via story points)
- Team's fully burdened cost (from HR/Finance)
- Feature value from Product Owner

**Converting to Annual Impact:**
- Monthly: 30K
- Annual: 30K × 12 = 360K

**Organizational Change Recommendation:**

**Capacity Allocation:**
- Dedicate 20% of sprint for handling interruptions/support
- Remaining 80% for planned work

**Rule:**
- Any unplanned work exceeding 20% support buffer must trigger **management-level root cause analysis**
- Compel upstream teams to invest in stability

**Result:** With 30% unplanned work, you're losing significant opportunity value and should address systemic issues.

   - Cultural sensitivity is uniquely human
   - Lived experience cannot be replicated

3. **Complex Interpersonal Skills**
   - Conflict resolution
   - Emotional awareness
   - Intuition and sensing
   - Collective ownership building

4. **Practical Example:**
   - AI can: Flag burnout risk using data
   - Only Scrum Master can: Facilitate conversation to address team morale

**What AI CAN Do:**
- Handle data tracking and analysis
- Automate repetitive admin tasks
- Generate automated reports
- Flag risks and patterns
- Provide data-based insights

**Future of Scrum Mastery:**

Scrum Masters of 2026 will:
- Use AI as a "team inside engine"
- Spend more time on team health and coaching
- Focus on conflict resolution
- Navigate cultural differences
- Invest in human leadership
- Make data-driven decisions (powered by AI)
- Become MORE strategic and valuable

**Key Analogy:**
"AI is a microscope; Scrum Master is the scientist."

**Important Caveat:**
- 30-40% of admin/tactical tasks can be automated
- Core role (coaching, facilitation, leadership) remains irreplaceable

### Q32: Shefali's Question: How does scope creep impact the team?

**Answer:**

**Definition:** Scope creep = new work entering mid-sprint, pulling team away from current commitments.

**Impact on Team:**
- Disrupts current work
- Causes context switching
- Reduces focus and flow
- Stresses the team
- Affects sprint goal achievement

**How to Manage (Real-World Example):**

**Scenario:** During active sprint, management requests urgent feature. What do you do?

1. **Get estimates from developers** on the urgent work effort
2. **Inform management** that existing work will be impacted
3. **Ensure developers understand requirements** (conduct refinement)
4. **Negotiate with PO, developers, and management** - What comes out of the sprint to make room?
5. **Maintain transparency** - Everyone should know the trade-offs
6. **Execute** - Pull out lower-priority items and bring in urgent work

**Golden Rules:**
- Scope creep cannot be regular; manage it when it happens
- Negotiation is key - something must leave if something comes in
- Everyone should be in sync about changes
- Developers should not be exhausted or pressurized

---

### Q33: How to handle velocity fluctuations across sprints?

**Answer:**

**Real-World Case Study:**

A Scrum Master noticed velocity patterns:
- High velocity: When working on enhancements of existing features
- Low velocity: When building entirely new features

**Root Causes to Investigate:**

1. **Type of Work**
   - Enhancements: Team knows codebase → faster
   - New features: Unknowns, spikes needed → slower
   - This is NATURAL variation

2. **New Team Members**
   - Adding new person → velocity drops for 2-3 sprints
   - Then normalizes
   - Expected behavior

3. **Leave Patterns**
   - Sick leave: Reduces capacity and velocity
   - Planned vacation: Factor in during planning

4. **Work Pressure**
   - Pressure situations: Team rushes, makes mistakes
   - Can artificially inflate velocity short-term
   - Unsustainable long-term

5. **Process Improvements**
   - New tools or processes: May temporary slow things
   - Then improve efficiency

**How to Address Velocity Fluctuations:**

✅ **Identify patterns** - Is it work type, team composition, or process?
✅ **Communicate with stakeholders** - Explain natural variations
✅ **Adjust forecasts** - Account for work type and team capacity
✅ **Don't panic** - Velocity variation is normal, not failure
✅ **Investigate thoroughly** - Don't jump to "underperformance" conclusion

**Expert Insight:**
"We need to identify what's working for the team and what's not. When velocity fluctuates, don't blame the team; investigate the system."

### Q34: Churn Rate / Scope Change Impact on Sprint

**Answer:**

**Definition:** Churn Rate = How many items are added/removed mid-sprint relative to committed items.

**Formula:**
```
Churn Rate = (Items added + Items removed) ÷ (Original committed items)
```

**Impact:**
- High churn = unstable sprints
- Makes velocity unreliable for forecasting
- Creates team stress and context switching

**Example:**
- Committed: 50 story points
- Added: 30 points
- Removed: 20 points
- Churn: (30+20)/50 = 100% (very high!)

**How to Control:**
- Protect sprint boundaries once started
- Have PO prioritize items before sprint planning
- Limit mid-sprint additions to true emergencies
- Track churn as sprint metric

---

### Q35: User Story Dependency Management

**Question:** A user story has dependencies. How do you handle it?

**Answer:**

**During Refinement/Sprint Planning:**

1. **Identify dependencies early**
   - Don't bring dependent stories into same sprint
   - Example: If Story B depends on Story A completion, Story B belongs in next sprint minimum

2. **Coordinate with dependent teams**
   - In SAFe: Ensure dependencies surface during SOS
   - Link stories in Jira
   - Plan accordingly

3. **If dependency must come mid-sprint:**
   - Check status of blocker work
   - Assess risk of delay
   - Have contingency plan
   - Keep team informed

4. **Risk Management:**
   - Document dependency clearly
   - Communicate dates to dependent team
   - Follow up proactively
   - Watch Scrum of Scrums for updates

**Best Practice:** Avoid dependencies within a sprint. Plan them across sprint boundaries.

   - High manual effort = bottleneck
   - Indicator for automation need

3. **Definition of Done Compliance**
   - Checklist completion rate
   - Code review quality
   - Test coverage
   - Documentation completeness

**How to Strengthen DOD:**
- Add automated testing requirement
- Mandate code review with specific criteria
- Include security checks
- Require documentation
